            <h3>Paraphrase question sequence into one question and rate the question sequence</h3>
            <p>
              Given a sequence of questions and the final answer, paraphrase the question sequence into one integrated and natural question that people would typically ask to get such information. Then, rate the question sequence according to its grammatical validity, coherency and likelihood of being raised.
